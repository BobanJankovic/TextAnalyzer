# TextAnalyzer
Our Application: A Text Analyzer
The application you’re going to develop in this chapter will be a text analyzer. Your Ruby code
will read in text supplied in a separate file, analyze it for various patterns and statistics, and
print out the results for the user. It’s not a 3D graphical adventure or a fancy web site, but text
processing programs are the bread and butter of systems administration and most application
development. They can be vital for parsing log files and user-submitted text on web sites, and
manipulating other textual data.
